## Original Data Set Description
The original data set, together with the detailed descriptions of the variables, can be found on this website:
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

## Transformations Performed
The following operations and transformations were performed on the original data by the R script:

1. Read the following data tables:
  * UCI HAR Dataset\features.txt
  * UCI HAR Dataset\activity_labels.txt
  * UCI HAR Dataset\train\subject_train.txt
  * UCI HAR Dataset\train\X_train.txt
  * UCI HAR Dataset\train\y_train.txt
  * UCI HAR Dataset\test\subject_test.txt
  * UCI HAR Dataset\test\X_test.txt
  * UCI HAR Dataset\test\y_test.txt
2. Assign column names for the two main data frames (x_train and x_test) based on the list of features
3. Add subject and activity columns in the front of the data frames (activity names obtained by table lookup)
4. Combine training and test data frames by row binding (both data frames have exactly the same columns)
5. Keep only the mean and standard deviation feature columns and remove all other feature variables
6. Rename columns to have more descriptive variable names
7. Group the data frame by subject and activity
8. Summarize the data by calculating averages grouped by each subject and activity
9. Correct grammar in activity name
10. Write the resulting tidy data set

## Tidy Data Set Description
The final tidy data set generated by the R script includes 180 observations (rows) of 68 variables (columns). The variables are described in detail below. Variables 3-68 represent the average observation for each subject and each activity across all variables from the original data set (training and test sets combined). Only the mean and standard deviation variables from the original data set were included (denoted "Mean" and "Std"), and the rest of the variables from the original data set were not included.
