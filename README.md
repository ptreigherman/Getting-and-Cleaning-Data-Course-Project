# Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project

## Repository Content
This repository includes the following files:
* This file - README.md
* Code book file - CodeBook.md, which describes the data set and the transformations performed to clean up the data 
* R script - run_analysis.R
* Output tidy data set in Rdata format - tidy.Rdata
* Output tidy data set in CSV format - tidy.csv

## How to Run
In order to run the R script, the folder with the original data sets called "UCI HAR Dataset" must be unzipped to the current folder. The R script reads the files from the "UCI HAR Dataset" folder and writes the output data sets to the current folder.
